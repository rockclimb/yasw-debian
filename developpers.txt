Implement your own filter
-------------------------
In order develop your own filter, you have to create a class that inherits from
BaseFilter and reimplement at least:

public:
    <Constructor>(QObject * parent = 0);
    QString getIdentifier();
    QString getName();
    QMap<QString, QVariant> getSettings();
    void setSettings(QMap <QString, QVariant> settings);
    void settings2Dom(QDomDocument &doc, QDomElement &parent, QMap<QString, QVariant> settings);
    QMap<QString, QVariant> dom2Settings(QDomElement &filterElement);

protected:
    virtual QImage filter(QImage inputImage);

This class should provide a widget that implements the AbstractFilterWidget.
The inherited methods (for example getWidget) from the BaseFilter don't need
to be reimplemented in most cases.

Each filter should be placed somewhere appropiate under the filter folder. The
name of the classes and files should begin with the filer name as in
getIdentifier().
If you create a new folder, don't forget to modifiy the INCLUDEPATH in yasw.pro.

Have a look at the BaseFilter and the Rotation class (folder filter/rotation)
for simple filter example.
