/*! \class Corner
    \brief Corner to build a polygon

    The corner is a circle (diameter 8 pixel) that can be moved to modify the lines
    connected to it (via Line::trackCorner). All the corner together build a polygon,
    wich moves with it.
    Corner is q QGraphicsItem wich is to be used in a QGraphicsScene/View.

    It ignores Transformation of the GraphicsView so that it has allways the same
    size while zooming.

    itemChanged ist called because the Flag ItemSendsGeometryChanges is set.

    and register that the Corner moved so that the transformation Matrix and the output Pixmap
    has to be recalculated.
