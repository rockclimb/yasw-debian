  \brief corner of the cropping rectangle

  A cropping rectangle is defined by its top left and bottom right corner.
  When they move, the Rectangle coordinates and size have to be changed.

    The corner is a circle (diameter 8 pixel) that can be moved to modify the rectangle.
    It ignores Transformation of the GraphicsView so that it has allways the same size while zooming.
